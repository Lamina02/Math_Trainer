## Math Trainer
A small application written in C#, that will allow you to refresh and train your basic math skills.
Choose between a set start time, calculation types and a set amount of exercises. Or just let it continue forever until you can't no-more :)

The app will display a summary screen summing up your results and giving out suggestions based on that.
